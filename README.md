# JATE (Just Another Text Editor)[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

## Description

  This project utilizes express, webpack, workbox, and babel to create a text editor with PWA functionality which utilizes cache memory to improve user experience on offline projects.

  The site may be accessed here: https://jate-hap.onrender.com/

### Mock-Up

The following animation demonstrates the application functionality:

  ### User Story

```md
AS A developer
I WANT to create notes or code snippets with or without an internet connection
SO THAT I can reliably retrieve them for later use
```

  ## Installation

  Click on the link on the top of the tab to download the PWA. You can run the app directly on your machine! Not all browsers support PWAs, so it is recommended that you access the site off of Google Chrome.
## Usage

  This can be used to securely type whatever you would like. No data is stored remotely, so everything you type there will be yours and yours alone.
